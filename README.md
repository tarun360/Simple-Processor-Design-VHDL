# CS 256: Simple Processor Design Project

Made by: Tarun Gupta (180001059) and Kartik Garg (180002027).

Clock period is 10 ns. The inputs A and B are available for ONLY 1st clock-cycle, during which they are stored in 8 bit registers. After the 1st clock-cycle, the inputs are not available (made 0s).

Description of Files:              

Adder: 8 bit full adder.

FA: 1 bit full adder.

Subtractor: 8 bit full subtractor.

Sub: 1 bit full subtractor.

Decoder: takes in 3 bit input, and outputs 8 bit output.

ALU_VHDL: Implementation of ALU.

PIPO_register_8: Implemntation of Parallel In, Parallel Out 8-bit register.

UP_counter: Implementation of 3-bit synchronous upcounter.   

Control_Unit: Control Unit.

A_part: Part A of 1st Problem set.

B_part: Part B of 1st Problem set.

C_part: Part C of 1st Problem set.

D_part: Part D of 1st Problem set.

E_part: Part E of 1st Problem set.

F_part: Part F of 1st Problem set.

G_part: Part G of 1st Problem set.

H_part: Part H of 1st Problem set.
